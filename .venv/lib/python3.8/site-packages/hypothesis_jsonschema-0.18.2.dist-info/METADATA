# hypothesis-jsonschema

A [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io) strategy for generating data
that matches some [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/).

[Here's the PyPI page.](https://pypi.org/project/hypothesis-jsonschema/)

## API

The public API consists of just one function: `hypothesis_jsonschema.from_schema`,
which takes a JSON schema and returns a strategy for allowed JSON objects.

```python
from hypothesis import given

from hypothesis_jsonschema import from_schema


@given(from_schema({"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "exclusiveMaximum": 10}))
def test_integers(value):
    assert isinstance(value, int)
    assert 1 <= value < 10


@given(
    from_schema(
        {"type": "string", "format": "card"},
        # Standard formats work out of the box.  Custom formats are ignored
        # by default, but you can pass custom strategies for them - e.g.
        custom_formats={"card": st.sampled_from(EXAMPLE_CARD_NUMBERS)},
    )
)
def test_card_numbers(value):
    assert isinstance(value, str)
    assert re.match(r"^\d{4} \d{4} \d{4} \d{4}$", value)
```

For more details on property-based testing and how to use or customise
strategies, [see the Hypothesis docs](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/).

JSONSchema drafts 04, 05, and 07 are fully tested and working.
As of version 0.11, this includes resolving non-recursive references!


## Supported versions

`hypothesis-jsonschema` requires Python 3.6 or later.
In general, 0.x versions will require very recent versions of all dependencies
because I don't want to deal with compatibility workarounds.

`hypothesis-jsonschema` may make backwards-incompatible changes at any time
before version 1.x - that's what semver means! - but I've kept the API surface
small enough that this should be avoidable.  The main source of breaks will be
if or when schema that never really worked turn into explicit errors instead
of generating values that don't quite match.
